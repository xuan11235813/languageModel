you know , one of the intense pleas@@ ures of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones pol@@ ished by rain , taste it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants .
just to know that Jag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still journey beyond the Mil@@ ky Way , or the my@@ ths of the I@@ nu@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ onate with meaning , or that in the Himal@@ aya , the Buddh@@ ists still pursue the breath of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthrop@@ ology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adap@@ tive choices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ beit successfully , many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ atives .
we 're all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we go through initi@@ ation ri@@ tes .
we have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separation of death , so it shouldn 't surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what 's interesting is the unique ca@@ dence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and whether it is the Pen@@ an in the forests of Bor@@ ne@@ o , or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ ytes in Haiti , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the Ka@@ is@@ ut desert of Northern Kenya , the Cur@@ ander@@ o in the mountains of the An@@ des , or a car@@ av@@ ans@@ er@@ ai in the middle of the Sahara - this is inci@@ dentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago - or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the sl@@ op@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , Everest , the go@@ dd@@ ess mother of the world .
all of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ enting yourself in the Earth .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that en@@ vel@@ ops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspir@@ ations , intui@@ tions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is humanity 's great legacy .
it 's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an aston@@ is@@ hing@@ ly in@@ quisi@@ tive species .
and just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere - and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
no biologists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 5@@ 0 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that - the most a@@ po@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scenario in the realm of biological diversity - scar@@ c@@ ely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
and the great indic@@ ator of that , of course , is language loss .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 languages spoken on the planet .
now , a language is not just a body of voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gram@@ mati@@ cal rules .
a language is a flash of the human spirit .
it 's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
every language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of the mind , a water@@ shed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whis@@ per@@ ed into the ears of children .
they 're no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they 're already dead .
what could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticip@@ ate the promise of the children ?
and yet , that d@@ read@@ ful f@@ ate is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and carries with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an ancient tongue .
and I know there 's some of you who say , " Well , wouldn 't it be better , wouldn 't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? " and I say , " Great , let 's make that language Yor@@ uba . let 's make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
let 's make it Ko@@ gi . "
and you 'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
and so , what I 'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a brief journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say " different ways of being , " I really do mean different ways of being .
take , for example , this child of a Bar@@ as@@ ana in the Nor@@ thwest Amazon , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that myth@@ ologically they came up the milk river from the east in the bel@@ ly of sacred sn@@ akes .
now , this is a people who c@@ ogni@@ tively do not distingu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ opy of the he@@ av@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ opy of the forest upon which the people depend .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called " lingu@@ istic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : " you must mar@@ ry someone who speaks a different language .
and this is all ro@@ oted in the myth@@ ological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone practic@@ ing a language .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Wa@@ or@@ ani of nor@@ the@@ astern E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an astonishing people first cont@@ acted peac@@ efully in 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ 8 .
in 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries attemp@@ ted contact and made a critical mistake .
they dropped from the air 8 x 1@@ 0 glo@@ ss@@ y photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly ges@@ tures , for@@ getting that these people of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they sp@@ ear@@ ed the five mis@@ sion@@ aries to death .
but the Wa@@ or@@ ani didn 't just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
they sp@@ ear@@ ed each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mortality was due to them sp@@ ear@@ ing each other .
we trac@@ ed gene@@ alo@@ gies back eight generations , and we found two inst@@ ances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mitted that one of the f@@ ellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we sp@@ ear@@ ed him anyway .
but at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
their hunter@@ s could smell animal ur@@ ine at 4@@ 0 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
in the early ' 8@@ 0 s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , inf@@ il@@ tr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of Du@@ v@@ ali@@ er 's strength and Ton@@ ton Mac@@ ou@@ tes , and sec@@ uring the poison used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
in order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of V@@ od@@ ou@@ n . and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
on the contrary , it 's a complex metaph@@ ysi@@ cal world@@ view .
it 's interesting .
if I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Chris@@ ti@@ an@@ ity , Islam , Buddh@@ ism , Ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
there 's always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . well , of course , they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is simply the dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the slavery era .
but , what makes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it 's this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so , the living give birth to the spiri@@ ts .
the spiri@@ ts can be inv@@ o@@ ked from beneath the Great W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the rhythm of the dance to moment@@ arily dis@@ place the soul of the living , so that for that brief sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ ol@@ yte becomes the god .
that 's why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that " You white people go to church and speak about God .
we dance in the tem@@ ple and become God . "
and because you are pos@@ s@@ essed , you are taken by the spirit - how can you be har@@ med ?
so you see these astonishing demon@@ str@@ ations : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ ytes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling burning em@@ bers with imp@@ unity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when cat@@ aly@@ zed in the state of extreme exc@@ itation .
now , of all the peoples that I 've ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Ko@@ gi of the Sierra N@@ ev@@ ada de Santa Mar@@ ta in northern Col@@ om@@ bia .
des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts of the ancient T@@ air@@ ona civilization which once car@@ pet@@ ed the C@@ ari@@ b@@ bean co@@ ast@@ al plain of Col@@ om@@ bia , in the wake of the con@@ quest , these people re@@ treated into an isolated volcan@@ ic massi@@ f that so@@ ars above the C@@ ari@@ b@@ bean co@@ ast@@ al plain .
in a bloo@@ d@@ st@@ ain@@ ed continent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the Spanish .
to this day , they remain rul@@ ed by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od but the training for the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is rather extraordinary .
the young ac@@ ol@@ ytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , se@@ ques@@ tered in a sha@@ dow@@ y world of darkness in stone hu@@ ts at the base of glaci@@ ers for 1@@ 8 years : two nin@@ e-@@ year periods deliber@@ ately chosen to mim@@ ic the nine months of gest@@ ation they spend in their natural mother 's wom@@ b ; now they are metaphor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
and for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their pra@@ yers and their pra@@ yers alone maintain the cosmic - or we might say the ecological - balance .
and at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 1@@ 8 , they see a sun@@ rise . and in that cryst@@ al moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to ba@@ the the sl@@ op@@ es of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is aff@@ ir@@ med in stun@@ ning gl@@ ory . and the pri@@ est steps back and says , " You see ? it 's really as I 've told you .
it is that beautiful . it is yours to protect . "
they call themselves the " el@@ der brothers " and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think of indi@@ genous people and landscape , we either inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the " no@@ ble sav@@ age , " which is an idea rac@@ ist in its simplicity , or altern@@ atively , we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ ore@@ au and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
well , indi@@ genous people are neither sen@@ tim@@ ental nor weak@@ ened by no@@ stal@@ gia .
there 's not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al sw@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing winds of Tibet , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , through time and ritual , for@@ ged a traditional my@@ sti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consciously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is bre@@ ath@@ ed into being by human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a young kid from the An@@ des who 's raised to believe that that mountain is an A@@ pu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Mon@@ tana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
whether it 's the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pile of ore is ir@@ relevant .
what 's interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
that made me a different human being than my friends amongst the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those forests were the abo@@ de of Hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the Cro@@ o@@ ked Be@@ ak of He@@ aven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spiri@@ ts that d@@ well@@ ed at the north end of the world , spiri@@ ts they would have to engage during their Ham@@ ats@@ a initi@@ ation .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different reali@@ ties , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . take this plant here .
it 's a photograph I took in the Nor@@ thwest Amazon just last April .
this is ay@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an 's re@@ per@@ to@@ ire .
what makes ay@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the sh@@ eer pharmac@@ ological potential of this prepar@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . it 's made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hallucin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic - to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue ha@@ zy smoke dri@@ ft across your consciousness - but it 's mixed with the leaves of a shr@@ u@@ b in the coffee family called Psych@@ o@@ tri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
this plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ otonin , di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine , 5 -@@ metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
if you 've ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami blowing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ ses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
to have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le barrel lined with b@@ aro@@ que paintings and land@@ ing on a sea of electricity .
it doesn 't create the distor@@ tion of reality ; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality .
in fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Sh@@ ul@@ tes - who is a man who spar@@ ked the psych@@ e@@ del@@ ic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1@@ 9@@ 3@@ 0 s - I used to argue that you couldn 't classi@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as hallucin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you 're under the effects there 's no one home anymore to experience a hallucin@@ ation .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they 're den@@ at@@ ured by an en@@ zy@@ me found naturally in the human gut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine ox@@ i@@ d@@ ase .
they can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the M@@ A@@ O .
now , the fascinating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are M@@ A@@ O inhi@@ bit@@ ors of the precise sort necessary to poten@@ ti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so you ask yourself a question .
how , in a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 species of vas@@ cular plants , do these people find these two morph@@ ologically un@@ related plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
well , we use that great eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism , " trial and error , " which is exposed to be mean@@ in@@ gl@@ ess .
but you ask the Indians , and they say , " The plants talk to us . "
well , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the C@@ of@@ an , has 1@@ 7 var@@ ie@@ ties of ay@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , all of which they distingu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
and then you ask them how they establ@@ ish their tax@@ onom@@ y and they say , " I thought you knew something about plants .
I mean , don 't you know anything ? " and I said , " No . "
well , it turns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 var@@ ie@@ ties in the night of a full moon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
now , that 's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it 's a lot more interesting than counting stam@@ ens .
now - - the problem - the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ thetic with the p@@ light of indi@@ genous people view them as qu@@ a@@ int and color@@ ful but somehow reduced to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
well , the truth is the 20 th century , 3@@ 0@@ 0 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively end@@ or@@ sed or passi@@ vely accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn 't change .
all cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and ar@@ row any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and bu@@ g@@ gy .
it 's not change or technology that threat@@ ens the integri@@ ty of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . it is power , the cru@@ de face of dom@@ ination .
wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destin@@ ed to fa@@ de away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it 's the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the hom@@ eland of the Pen@@ an - a nom@@ adic people from Sou@@ theast Asia , from Sar@@ a@@ wa@@ k - a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to serv@@ it@@ ude and prostitu@@ tion on the banks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ iled with the sil@@ t that seems to be carrying half of Bor@@ ne@@ o away to the South China Sea , where the Japanese frei@@ ghters hang light in the hori@@ zon ready to fill their holds with raw lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the forest - or , in the case of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami , it 's the disease enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research recently , you 'll see it 's a cru@@ de face of political dom@@ ination .
you know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the destruction of people 's way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it 's univers@@ ally , in many quarters , celebr@@ ated as part of a development strategy .
and you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
I once tra@@ v@@ elled 6@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 miles from Ch@@ eng@@ du in Western China over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ astern Tibet to L@@ has@@ a with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to L@@ has@@ a that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 sacred mon@@ um@@ ents tor@@ n apart to dust and as@@ hes , 1@@ .@@ 2 million people killed by the c@@ ad@@ r@@ es during the C@@ ul@@ tural Revolution .
this young man 's father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the Pan@@ chen Lama .
that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese inv@@ asion .
his uncle fl@@ ed with H@@ is Hol@@ iness in the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to Nepal .
his mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the crime of being wealthy .
he was sm@@ ug@@ gled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her sk@@ ir@@ t tails because she couldn 't bear to be without him .
the sister who had done that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an education camp .
one day she in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently stepped on an arm@@ band of Ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gres@@ sion , she was given seven years of hard labor .
the pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to beh@@ old .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ och@@ ro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embrace a poly@@ ch@@ ro@@ matic world of diversity ?
Margar@@ et Me@@ ad , the great anthrop@@ ologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we dri@@ fted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ orph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow mod@@ ality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
and it 's hum@@ bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for [ 1@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 ] years .
the Ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic Revolution - which gave us agriculture , at which time we suc@@ cum@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the seed ; the poetry of the sh@@ am@@ an was dis@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od ; we created hierarchy speci@@ alization sur@@ plus - is only 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 3@@ 0@@ 0 years old .
now , that sh@@ allow history doesn 't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the en@@ su@@ ing m@@ illen@@ nia .
when these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 different voices .
and it 's within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peoples and all gar@@ dens find a way to flour@@ ish . and there are great moments of optim@@ ism .
this is a photograph I took at the northern tip of B@@ aff@@ in Island when I went nar@@ wh@@ al hunting with some I@@ nu@@ it people , and this man , O@@ la@@ y@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grandfather .
the Cana@@ dian government has not always been kind to the I@@ nu@@ it people , and during the 1@@ 9@@ 5@@ 0 s , to establ@@ ish our so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty , we forced them into sett@@ le@@ ments .
this old man 's grandfather ref@@ used to go .
the family , fear@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
now , you must understand that the I@@ nu@@ it did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
the run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were originally made of fish wrapped in car@@ i@@ b@@ ou hide .
so , this man 's grandfather was not in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated by the Arctic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blowing .
he simply sli@@ pped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin tr@@ ous@@ ers and def@@ ec@@ ated into his hand . and as the f@@ ec@@ es began to free@@ ze , he shaped it into the form of a bl@@ ade .
he put a spray of s@@ ali@@ va on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally fro@@ ze solid , he but@@ ch@@ ered a dog with it .
he sk@@ inn@@ ed the dog and improvis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the rib@@ c@@ age of the dog and improvis@@ ed a sl@@ ed , har@@ n@@ essed up an ad@@ jac@@ ent dog , and disappeared over the ice flo@@ es , shit knife in belt .
talk about getting by with nothing .
and this , in many ways - - is a symbol of the resilience of the I@@ nu@@ it people and of all indi@@ genous people around the world .
the Cana@@ dian government in April of 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9 gave back to total control of the I@@ nu@@ it an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
it 's our new hom@@ eland . it 's called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
it 's an independent terri@@ tory . they control all min@@ eral resources .
an amazing example of how a nation@@ -@@ state can seek res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion with its people .
and finally , in the end , I think it 's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who 've traveled in these remote re@@ aches of the planet , to realize that they 're not remote at all .
they 're hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
they represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked ge@@ ography of hope .
so , what we 're trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accompl@@ ish anything .
we think that pol@@ em@@ ics - - we think that pol@@ em@@ ics are not persu@@ asive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . we get 3@@ 5 million hits on our website every month .
1@@ 5@@ 6 nations carry our television channel .
our mag@@ az@@ ines are read by millions .
and what we 're doing is a series of jour@@ neys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we 're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away da@@ zz@@ led by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthrop@@ ology : that this world deser@@ ves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural , pl@@ ur@@ alistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you very much .
what I 'm going to show you first , as quickly as I can , is some found@@ ational work , some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acqu@@ isi@@ tion almost exactly a year ago . this is Se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on , and it 's an environment in which you can either locally or remo@@ tely interact with vast amounts of visual data .
we 're looking at many , many gi@@ gab@@ ytes of digital photos here and kind of se@@ am@@ lessly and continuously zo@@ oming in , pan@@ ning through the thing , re@@ arran@@ ging it in any way we want .
and it doesn 't matter how much information we 're looking at , how big these collec@@ tions are or how big the images are .
most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the Library of Congress , and it 's in the 3@@ 0@@ 0 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el range .
it doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at any given moment . it 's also very flexible architecture .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non-@@ image data .
this is " B@@ lea@@ k House " by D@@ ickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove to you that it 's really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real representation of the text ; it 's not a picture .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-@@ book .
I wouldn 't recommend it .
this is a more realistic case . this is an issue of The Guardian .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an inher@@ ently multi-@@ scale kind of medium .
we 've also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian .
we 've made up a fake ad that 's very high resolution - much higher than you 'd be able to get in an ordinary ad - and we 've embedded extra content .
if you want to see the features of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fic@@ ations .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate .
we hope that this means no more pop@@ -@@ ups and other kind of rub@@ b@@ ish like that - shouldn 't be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and this one I really won 't spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well .
but those are all the roads in the U.S.
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a NASA ge@@ o@@ spati@@ al image .
so let 's pull up , now , something else .
this is actually live on the Web now ; you can go check it out .
this is a project called Photo@@ syn@@ th , which really mar@@ ries two different technologies .
one of them is Se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by No@@ ah S@@ n@@ av@@ ely , a graduate student at the University of Washington , co-@@ advis@@ ed by Steve Sei@@ tz at U.@@ W@@ .
and Rick S@@ zel@@ is@@ ki at Microsoft Research . a very nice collaboration .
and so this is live on the Web . it 's powered by Se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views , where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-@@ resolution experience .
but the spati@@ al arran@@ ge@@ ment of the images here is actually meaningful .
the computer vision algorithms have reg@@ ister@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respond to the real space in which these shots - all taken near Gr@@ assi L@@ akes in the Cana@@ dian Rock@@ ies - all these shots were taken . so you see elements here of stabili@@ zed sli@@ de-@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imaging , and these things have all been related spati@@ ally .
I 'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments .
there are some that are much more spati@@ al .
I would like to jump straight to one of No@@ ah 's original dat@@ a-@@ sets - and this is from an early prototype of Photo@@ syn@@ th that we first got working in the summer - to show you what I think is really the p@@ unch line behind this technology , the Photo@@ syn@@ th technology . and it 's not necessarily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environments that we 've put up on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
this is a re@@ construction of No@@ tr@@ e Dame Ca@@ thedr@@ al that was done entirely comput@@ ation@@ ally from images sc@@ raped from Flickr . you just type No@@ tr@@ e Dame into Flickr , and you get some pictures of guys in t-@@ shi@@ rts , and of the campus and so on . and each of these orange con@@ es represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model .
and so these are all Flickr images , and they 've all been related spati@@ ally in this way .
and we can just navigate in this very simple way .
you know , I never thought that I 'd end up working at Microsoft .
it 's very grati@@ fying to have this kind of rec@@ eption here .
I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras : it 's everything from cell phone cameras to professional S@@ L@@ R@@ s , quite a large number of them , sti@@ t@@ ched together in this environment .
and if I can , I 'll find some of the sort of weird ones .
so many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by faces , and so on .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs - here we go .
this is actually a poster of No@@ tr@@ e Dame that reg@@ ister@@ ed correctly .
we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody - from the entire collective memory of , visu@@ ally , of what the Earth looks like - and link all of that together .
all of those photos become linked together , and they make something emerg@@ ent that 's greater than the sum of the parts .
you have a model that emerg@@ es of the entire Earth .
think of this as the long tail to Stephen La@@ w@@ ler 's Vir@@ tual Earth work .
and this is something that grows in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
their own photos are getting tagged with met@@ a-@@ data that somebody else entered .
if somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to tag all of these sa@@ ints and say who they all are , then my photo of No@@ tr@@ e Dame Ca@@ thedr@@ al suddenly gets en@@ rich@@ ed with all of that data , and I can use it as an en@@ try point to dive into that space , into that met@@ a-@@ verse , using everybody else 's photos , and do a kind of a cross-@@ mod@@ al and cross-@@ user social experience that way .
and of course , a by-@@ product of all of that is immen@@ sely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , collected not just from overhead fli@@ ghts and from satellite images and so on , but from the collective memory .
thank you so much .
do I understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ?
Yes . what this is really doing is discovering .
it 's creating hyper@@ links , if you will , between images .
and it 's doing that based on the content inside the images .
and that gets really exciting when you think about the rich@@ ness of the sem@@ an@@ tic information that a lot of those images have .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in phr@@ ases , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
then the amount of sem@@ an@@ tic inter@@ connection and the amount of rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge . it 's a classic network effect .
B@@ la@@ ise , that is truly incredible . con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ations .
thanks so much .
I 'm going to talk to you about some stuff that 's in this book of mine that I hope will res@@ onate with other things you 've already heard , and I 'll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss them .
I want to start with what I call the " official do@@ g@@ ma . "
the official do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
the official do@@ g@@ ma of all western industrial societies .
and the official do@@ g@@ ma runs like this : if we are interested in maxim@@ izing the welfare of our citizens , the way to do that is to maxim@@ ize individual freedom .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , wor@@ th@@ while , essential to being human .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maxim@@ ize our welfare , and no one has to decide on our behalf .
the way to maxim@@ ize freedom is to maxim@@ ize choice .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more welfare they have .
this , I think , is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn 't occur to anyone to question it .
and it 's also deeply embedded in our lives .
I 'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
this is my supermarket . not such a big one .
I want to say just a word about sal@@ ad d@@ ressing .
1@@ 7@@ 5 sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my supermarket , if you don 't count the 1@@ 0 extra@@ -@@ vir@@ gin o@@ live o@@ ils and 1@@ 2 bal@@ sam@@ ic vin@@ eg@@ ars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings , in the off-@@ chance that none of the 1@@ 7@@ 5 the store has on offer suit you .
so this is what the supermarket is like .
and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a ster@@ eo system - speakers , CD player , tape player , tun@@ er , ampli@@ fi@@ er - and in this one single consumer electronics store , there are that many ster@@ eo systems .
we can construct six@@ -and-@@ a-@@ half-@@ million different ster@@ eo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
you 've got to admit that 's a lot of choice .
in other dom@@ a@@ ins - the world of communications .
there was a time , when I was a boy , when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted , as long as it came from M@@ a Bell .
you r@@ ented your phone . you didn 't buy it .
one consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and those days are gone .
we now have an almost un@@ limited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
these are cell phones of the future .
my favorite is the middle one - the M@@ P@@ 3 player , nose hair tri@@ m@@ mer , and cre@@ me bru@@ le@@ e tor@@ ch .
and if by some chance you haven 't seen that in your store yet , you can rest as@@ su@@ red that one day soon you will .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
the answer is " No . "
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
so , in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care - it is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , " Well , we could do A , or we could do B.
a has these benefits , and these risks .
B has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? "
and you say , " Doc , what should I do ? "
and the do@@ c says , " A has these benefits and risks , and B has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ? "
and you say , " If you were me , Doc , what would you do ? "
and the do@@ c says , " But I 'm not you . "
and the result is - we call it " patient autonom@@ y , " which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something - namely , the doctor - to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions - namely , the patient .
there 's enormous marketing of prescri@@ ption drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can 't buy them .
why do they market to us if we can 't buy them ?
the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescri@@ p@@ tions to be changed .
something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indic@@ ate .
we don 't inher@@ it an identity ; we get to invent it .
and we get to re-@@ invent ourselves as often as we like .
and that means that everyday , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
with respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the def@@ ault assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
nowadays , everything is very much up for grab@@ s .
I teach wonder@@ fully intelligent students , and I assig@@ n 20 percent less work than I used to .
and it 's not because they 're less smart , and it 's not because they 're less di@@ ligent .
it 's because they are pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed , asking themselves , " Sh@@ ould I get married or not ? should I get married now ?
should I get married later ? should I have kids first , or a career first ? "
all of these are consum@@ ing questions .
and they 're going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work I assig@@ n and not getting a good grade in my cour@@ ses .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
work - we are bl@@ essed , as Carl was pointing out , with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet - except the R@@ and@@ ol@@ ph Hotel .
there is one corner , by the way , that I 'm not going to tell anybody about , where the Wi@@ Fi works .
I 'm not telling you about it because I want to use it .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn 't be working .
we can go to watch our kid play so@@ c@@ cer , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry on our other hip , and our laptop , pres@@ um@@ ably , on our l@@ aps .
and even if they 're all shut off , every minute that we 're watching our kid mu@@ ti@@ late a so@@ c@@ cer game , we are also asking ourselves , " Sh@@ ould I answer this cell phone call ?
should I respond to this email ? should I d@@ raft this letter ? "
and even if the answer to the question is " no , " it 's certainly going to make the experience of your kid 's so@@ c@@ cer game very different than it would 've been .
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle things , life is a matter of choice .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
and the answer is yes .
we all know what 's good about it , so I 'm going to talk about what 's bad about it .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , para@@ dox@@ ically , is that it produces paraly@@ sis , rather than liber@@ ation .
with so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
I 'll give you one very dramatic example of this : a study that was done of investments in volun@@ tary retirement plans .
a colleague of mine got access to investment records from Van@@ gu@@ ard , the gigan@@ tic mu@@ tual fund company of about a million employees and about 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 different work@@ places .
and what she found is that for every 1@@ 0 mu@@ tual funds the emplo@@ yer offered , rate of participation went down two percent .
you offer 5@@ 0 funds - 1@@ 0 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five . why ?
because with 5@@ 0 funds to choose from , it 's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you 'll just put it off until tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they don 't have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the emplo@@ yer .
by not particip@@ ating , they are passing up as much as 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 dollars a year from the emplo@@ yer , who would happ@@ ily match their contribution .
so paraly@@ sis is a consequence of having too many choices .
and I think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to get the decision right if it 's for all et@@ ern@@ ity , right ?
you don 't want to pick the wrong mu@@ tual fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad d@@ ressing .
so that 's one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paraly@@ sis and make a choice , we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings to choose from , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect - and , you know , what sal@@ ad d@@ ressing is ? - it 's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imagined alternative in@@ duc@@ es you to regret the decision you made , and this regret sub@@ trac@@ ts from the satis@@ faction you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
the more options there are , the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disap@@ pointing about the option that you chose .
second , what economists call " opportunity costs . "
Dan G@@ il@@ bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to .
well , when there are lots of alternatives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you re@@ ject , that make you less satis@@ fied with the alternative that you 've chosen .
here 's an example . for those of you who aren 't New Yor@@ kers , I ap@@ ologi@@ ze .
but here 's what you 're supposed to be thinking .
here 's this couple on the H@@ amp@@ tons .
very expensive real estate .
gor@@ ge@@ ous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
what could be better ? " well , damn it , " this guy is thinking , " It 's August .
everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away .
I could be parking right in front of my building . "
and he sp@@ ends two weeks n@@ ag@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space .
opportunity costs sub@@ tract from the satis@@ faction we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terrific .
and the more options there are to consider , the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflec@@ ted by us as opportunity costs .
here 's another example .
now this cartoon makes a lot of points .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
but one point it makes is that whenever you 're choo@@ sing one thing , you 're choo@@ sing not to do other things .
and those other things may have lots of attractive features , and it 's going to make what you 're doing less attractive .
third : es@@ cal@@ ation of expectations .
this hit me when I went to replace my je@@ ans .
I wear je@@ ans almost all the time .
and there was a time when je@@ ans came in one flavor , and you bought them , and they fit like cra@@ p , and they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if you wor@@ e them long enough and was@@ hed them enough times , they started to feel OK .
so I went to replace my je@@ ans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and I said , you know , " I want a pair of je@@ ans . here 's my size . "
and the sh@@ op@@ ke@@ ep@@ er said , " Do you want sli@@ m fit , easy fit , relax@@ ed fit ?
you want button fly or zi@@ pper fly ? you want st@@ on@@ e@@ was@@ hed or aci@@ d-@@ was@@ hed ?
do you want them dis@@ tr@@ essed ?
you want bo@@ ot cut , you want ta@@ per@@ ed , blah blah blah ... " O@@ n and on he went .
my ja@@ w dropped , and after I re@@ covered , I said , " I want the kind that used to be the only kind . "
he had no idea what that was , so I spent an hour trying on all these damn je@@ ans , and I walked out of the store - truth ! - with the best@@ -@@ fit@@ ting je@@ ans I had ever had .
I did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better .
but I felt worse .
why ? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
the reason I felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expectations about how good a pair of je@@ ans should be went up .
I had very low - I had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor .
when they came in 1@@ 0@@ 0 fla@@ vors , damn it , one of them should 've been perfect .
and what I got was good , but it wasn 't perfect .
and so I compared what I got to what I expected , and what I got was disap@@ pointing in comparison to what I expected .
adding options to people 's lives can 't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be .
and what that 's going to produce is less satis@@ faction with results , even when they 're good results .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if they did , you wouldn 't all know what this was about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
nowadays , the world we live in - we aff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ alized citizens , with perf@@ ection the expec@@ tation - the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
you will never be pleas@@ antly surprised because your expectations , my expectations , have gone through the roof .
the secret to happiness - this is what you all came for - the secret to happiness is low expectations .
I want to say - just a little auto@@ bi@@ ographical moment - that I actually am married to a wife , and she 's really quite wonderful .
I couldn 't have done better . I didn 't sett@@ le .
but sett@@ ling isn 't always such a bad thing .
finally , one consequence of buying a bad@@ -@@ fit@@ ting pair of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who 's responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
when there are hundreds of different st@@ y@@ les of je@@ ans available , and you buy one that is disap@@ pointing , and you ask why , who 's responsible ?
it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you .
you could have done better .
with a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on display , there is no excuse for failure .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel disap@@ pointed about them ; they blame themselves .
clinical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
I believe a significant - not the only , but a significant - contribut@@ or to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are disap@@ pointing because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they 're at fau@@ lt .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , objec@@ tively , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it 's all false . it is not true .
there 's no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn 't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
there 's some magical amount . I don 't know what it is .
I 'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare .
now , as a policy matter - I 'm almost done - as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material aff@@ lu@@ ence .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
their problem is that they have too little .
so the stuff I 'm talking about is the peculi@@ ar problem of modern , aff@@ lu@@ ent , Western societies .
and what is so fru@@ strating and inf@@ uri@@ ating is this : Steve Lev@@ it@@ t talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficul@@ t-@@ to-@@ inst@@ all child seats don 't help . it 's a waste of money .
what I 'm telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices - it 's not simply that they don 't help .
they actually hurt .
they actually make us worse off .
if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shi@@ fted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people 's lives be improved , but ours would be improved also .
this is what economists call a " Par@@ et@@ o-@@ improving move . "
income re@@ distribution will make everyone better off - not just poor people - because of how all this ex@@ cess choice pl@@ ag@@ ues us .
so to conclude . you 're supposed to read this cartoon , and , being a sophisticated person , say , " Ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , nothing is possible in this f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l . "
im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a my@@ op@@ ic view of the world - and that 's the way I read it at first .
the more I thought about it , however , the more I came to the view that this fish knows something .
because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you don 't have freedom . you have paraly@@ sis .
if you sh@@ at@@ ter this f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you decrease satis@@ faction .
you increase paraly@@ sis , and you decrease satis@@ faction .
everybody needs a f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l .
this one is almost certainly too limited - perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
but the abs@@ ence of some metaphor@@ ical f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l is a recipe for mis@@ ery , and , I suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , I 've talked about some of these projects before - about the human genome and what that might mean , and discovering new sets of genes .
we 're actually starting at a new point : we 've been digi@@ ti@@ zing biology , and now we 're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthes@@ izing life .
so , we 've always been trying to ask big questions .
" what is life ? " is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
we 've tried various approaches , par@@ ing it down to minim@@ al components .
we 've been digi@@ ti@@ zing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequ@@ enced the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
now we 're trying to ask , " Can we re@@ generate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? "
this is the map of a small organism , My@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gen@@ itali@@ um , that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-@@ replicate in the laboratory , and we 've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
we 're able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 1@@ 0@@ 0 genes out of the 5@@ 0@@ 0 or so that are here .
when we look at its met@@ abo@@ lic map , it 's relatively simple compared to ours - trust me , this is simple - but when we look at all the genes that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it 's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthes@@ ize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and so we started down the road of : can we synthes@@ ize a chromosome ?
can chemistry per@@ mit making these really large molecules where we 've never been before ?
and if we do , can we bo@@ ot up a chromosome ?
a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chemical material .
so , our pace of digi@@ ti@@ zing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our latest point would put it on , now , an exponential curve .
we started this over 1@@ 5 years ago .
it took several stages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ ethical review before we did the first experiments .
but it turns out synthes@@ izing DNA is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA - 3@@ 0 to 5@@ 0 letters in length - and it 's a de@@ generate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more errors there are .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of p@@ hi X@@ 1@@ 7@@ 4 .
it 's a small virus that kills bacteria .
we designed the pieces , went through our error correc@@ tion and had a DNA molecule of about 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli .
I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model .
they laugh@@ ed more than you guys are .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome - it 's over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 letters of genetic code - so we thought we 'd build them in c@@ ass@@ et@@ tes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the c@@ ass@@ et@@ tes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
design is critical , and if you 're starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
when we first sequ@@ enced this genome in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 5 , the standard of accur@@ acy was one error per 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 base pairs .
we actually found , on res@@ equ@@ encing it , 3@@ 0 errors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be boo@@ ted up .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 5@@ 0 letters long that have to over@@ lap with all the other 5@@ 0 -@@ letter pieces to build smaller sub@@ units we have to design so they can go together .
we design unique elements into this .
you may have read that we put water@@ marks in .
think of this : we have a four-@@ letter genetic code - A , C , G and T.
tri@@ ple@@ ts of those letters code for roughly 20 am@@ ino acids , such that there 's a single letter desig@@ nation for each of the am@@ ino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , all we did was auto@@ graph it .
some people were disap@@ pointed there was not poetry .
we designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enz@@ ym@@ es ; there are enz@@ ym@@ es that repair them and put them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 to 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 letters , put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 -@@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abund@@ ance so we could sequence them because we 're trying to create a process that 's extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
we 're trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation .
so , this looks like a bask@@ etball play@@ off .
when we get into these really large pieces over 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 base pairs , they won 't any longer grow rea@@ di@@ ly in E. coli - it ex@@ hau@@ sts all the modern tools of molecular biology - and so we turned to other mechanisms .
we knew there 's a mechanism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ combination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together .
here 's an example of it : there 's an organism called D@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ cus radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radiation .
you can see in the top panel , its chromosome just gets blown apart .
T@@ wel@@ ve to 2@@ 4 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be totally des@@ ic@@ c@@ ated ; they can live in a vacuum .
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space , move around , find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment .
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of this is out there .
here 's an actual micro@@ graph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using ye@@ ast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; ye@@ ast puts them together automatically .
this is not an electron micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular phot@@ om@@ icro@@ graph .
it 's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope .
these are pictures over about a six-@@ second period .
so , this is the public@@ ation we had just a short while ago .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 letters of genetic code ; it 's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
it 's over 3@@ 0@@ 0 million molecular weight .
if we printed it out at a 1@@ 0 f@@ ont with no spac@@ ing , it takes 1@@ 4@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we bo@@ ot up a chromosome ? how do we activ@@ ate this ?
obviously , with a virus it 's pretty simple ; it 's much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
it 's also simpler when you go into eu@@ kar@@ y@@ otes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nu@@ cle@@ us and pop in another one , and that 's what you 've all heard about with cl@@ oning .
with bacteria and Ar@@ cha@@ ea , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
we pur@@ i@@ fied a chromosome from one microbial species - roughly , these two are as distant as human and mice - we added a few extra genes so we could sel@@ ect for this chromosome , we di@@ ges@@ ted it with enz@@ ym@@ es to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell - and you 'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
this is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere , adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
there are enz@@ ym@@ es called restri@@ ction enz@@ ym@@ es that actually di@@ gest DNA .
the chromosome that was in the cell doesn 't have one ; the chromosome we put in does .
it got expres@@ sed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
all the proteins changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es changed ; when we read the genetic code , it 's exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
so , this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y , but we can , by moving the software of DNA around , change things quite dramatically .
now I 've argu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ esis ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
and I 've argu@@ ed that we 're about to perhaps create a new version of the Cam@@ bri@@ an explosion , where there 's massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
why do this ?
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
we 're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 4@@ 0 years .
to put it in context for myself : I was born in 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 6 .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 6 ; within 4@@ 0 years , there 'll be four .
we have trouble feeding , providing fresh , clean water , medic@@ ines , fuel for the six and a half billion .
it 's going to be a stretch to do it for nine .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 3@@ 0 billi@@ on-@@ plus bar@@ rel@@ s of oil - that 's a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there 's all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think of these as the design components of the future .
the electronics industry only had a dozen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
we 're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination .
we now have techniques , because of these rapid methods of synthesis , to do what we 're calling combin@@ atori@@ al genom@@ ics .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
when you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimi@@ ze processes to produce oc@@ tan@@ e or to produce pharmaceu@@ tic@@ als , new vaccines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
and it 's just standard selection : we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ ability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc .
this is a screen sn@@ ap@@ shot of some true design software that we 're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
you know , we don 't know necessarily what it 'll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
we 're focusing on now four@@ th-@@ generation fuels .
you 've seen recently , corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment .
we have secon@@ d@@ - and thir@@ d-@@ generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much high@@ er-@@ value fuels like oc@@ tan@@ e or different types of but@@ anol .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limit@@ ing its avail@@ ability is if we start with CO2 as its feed@@ stock , and so we 're working with designing cells to go down this road .
and we think we 'll have the first four@@ th-@@ generation fuels in about 1@@ 8 months .
sunlight and CO2 is one method ...
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other methods .
this is an organism we described in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing-@@ water temperatures .
it takes CO2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source .
we 're looking to see if we can take captured CO2 , which can easily be pi@@ ped to sites , convert that CO2 back into fuel to drive this process .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of " What is life ? "
we truly , you know , have mo@@ dest goals of replac@@ ing the whole petro@@ l-@@ chemical industry - Yeah . if you can 't do that at TED , where can you ? - become a major source of energy ...
but also , we 're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines .
you 've seen this year with flu ; we 're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
I think that can be changed by building combin@@ atori@@ al vaccines in advance .
here 's what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , spe@@ eding up evolution with synthetic bacteria , Ar@@ cha@@ ea and , eventually , eu@@ kar@@ y@@ otes .
we 're a ways away from improving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
last year at TED I gave an introduc@@ tion to the L@@ HC .
and I promised to come back and give you an up@@ date on how that machine worked .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren 't there , the L@@ HC is the largest scientific experiment ever attemp@@ ted - 2@@ 7 kilometers in circum@@ ference .
its job is to re@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 6@@ 0@@ 0 million times a second .
it 's nothing if not ambi@@ tious .
this is the machine below Gen@@ ev@@ a .
we take the pictures of those mini@@ -@@ Big Ban@@ gs inside detec@@ tors .
this is the one I work on . it 's called the AT@@ L@@ A@@ S detector - 4@@ 4 meters wide , 2@@ 2 meters in diameter .
spectacular picture here of AT@@ L@@ A@@ S under construction so you can see the scale .
on the 1@@ 0 th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by AT@@ L@@ A@@ S .
it caused immense celebr@@ ation in the control room .
it 's a picture of the first be@@ am particle going all the way around the L@@ HC , col@@ li@@ ding with a piece of the L@@ HC deliber@@ ately , and sh@@ ow@@ ering particles into the detector .
in other words , when we saw that picture on September 1@@ 0 th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ um@@ ph .
I don 't know whether this got the biggest che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here - these gold wires .
those wires carry 1@@ 3 thousand am@@ ps when the machine is working in full power .
now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , " No they don 't . they 're small wires . "
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what 's called super@@ conduc@@ ting wire .
so at minus 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current .
in one of the jo@@ ints between over 9@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 mag@@ nets in L@@ HC , there was a manufacturing def@@ ect .
so the wire he@@ ated up slightly , and its 1@@ 3@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 am@@ ps suddenly encounter@@ ed electrical resistance .
this was the result .
now that 's more impressive when you consider those mag@@ nets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
so we damaged about 5@@ 0 of the mag@@ nets .
we had to take them out , which we did .
we re@@ condi@@ tioned them all , fixed them .
they 're all on their way back underground now .
by the end of March the L@@ HC will be intact again .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in June or July , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now of course , in a way those accidents reig@@ ni@@ te the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it 's easy to refu@@ te .
I think that the fact that it 's so difficult , the fact that we 're over@@ reaching , is the value of things like the L@@ HC .
I will leave the final word to an English scientist , Hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ avy , who , I suspect , when def@@ ending his pro@@ te@@ ge 's useless experiments - his pro@@ te@@ ge was Michael Far@@ ad@@ ay - said this , " No@@ thing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteri@@ es in nature , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complete , and that there are no new worlds to con@@ quer . "
thank you .
I am a writer .
writing books is my profession but it 's more than that , of course .
it is also my great lif@@ el@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation .
and I don 't expect that that 's ever going to change .
but , that said , something kind of peculi@@ ar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to rec@@ ali@@ brate my whole relationship with this work .
and the peculi@@ ar thing is that I recently wrote this book , this mem@@ o@@ ir called " E@@ at , Pr@@ ay , Love " which , deci@@ de@@ dly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sensation , international best@@ seller thing .
the result of which is that everywhere I go now , people treat me like I 'm do@@ om@@ ed .
seriously - do@@ om@@ ed , do@@ om@@ ed !
like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , " Ar@@ en 't you afraid - aren 't you afraid you 're never going to be able to top that ?
aren 't you afraid you 're going to keep writing for your whole life and you 're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world car@@ es about at all , ever again ? "
so that 's re@@ ass@@ uring , you know .
but it would be worse , except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when I first started telling people - when I was a teen@@ ager - that I wanted to be a writer , I was met with this same kind of , sort of fear@@ -based reaction .
and people would say , " Ar@@ en 't you afraid you 're never going to have any success ?
aren 't you afraid the hum@@ ili@@ ation of re@@ j@@ ection will kill you ?
aren 't you afraid that you 're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing 's ever going to come of it and you 're going to die on a scra@@ p he@@ ap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bit@@ ter ash of failure ? "
like that , you know .
the answer - the short answer to all those questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
and I always have been .
and I 'm afraid of many , many more things besides that people can 't even guess at .
like sea@@ we@@ ed , and other things that are scary .
but , when it comes to writing , the thing that I 've been sort of thinking about l@@ ately , and wondering about l@@ ately , is why ?
you know , is it rational ?
is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
you know , and what is it specifically about creative v@@ entures that seems to make us really nervous about each other 's mental health in a way that other car@@ eers kind of don 't do , you know ?
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and I don 't rec@@ all once in his 4@@ 0 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
it didn 't - that chemical engineering block John , how 's it going ?
it just didn 't come up like that , you know ?
but to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven 't really ear@@ ned a rep@@ utation over the centuries for being alco@@ ho@@ lic man@@ ic@@ -@@ depres@@ si@@ ves .
we writers , we kind of do have that rep@@ utation , and not just writers , but creative people across all gen@@ r@@ es , it seems , have this rep@@ utation for being enorm@@ ously mentally un@@ stable .
and all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m death count in the 20 th century alone , of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
and even the ones who didn 't literally commit suicide seem to be really und@@ one by their gif@@ ts , you know .
Nor@@ man Ma@@ iler , just before he died , last interview , he said " E@@ very one of my books has killed me a little more . "
an extraordinary statement to make about your life 's work , you know .
but we don 't even bl@@ ink when we hear somebody say this because we 've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we 've completely inter@@ n@@ alized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inher@@ ently linked and that arti@@ stry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to an@@ gu@@ ish .
and the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
are you comfortable with that - because you look at it even from an inch away and , you know - I 'm not at all comfortable with that assumption .
I think it 's o@@ di@@ ous .
and I also think it 's dangerous , and I don 't want to see it perpet@@ u@@ ated into the next century .
I think it 's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
and I definitely know that , in my case - in my situation - it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dark path of assumption , particularly given the circum@@ st@@ ance that I 'm in right now in my career .
which is - you know , like check it out , I 'm pretty young , I 'm only about 4@@ 0 years old .
I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
and it 's exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be jud@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish success of my last book , right ?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we 're all sort of friends here now - it 's exc@@ e@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
Oh , so Jesus , what a thought !
you know that 's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o 'clock in the morning , and I don 't want to go there .
I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
and so , it seems to me , upon a lot of reflection , that the way that I have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that I have to create some sort of prot@@ ective psychological construct , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as I am writing , and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
and , as I 've been looking over the last year for models for how to do that I 've been sort of looking across time , and I 've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the inher@@ ent emotional risks of creativity .
and that search has led me to ancient Gre@@ ec@@ e and ancient R@@ ome .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
but , ancient Gre@@ ec@@ e and ancient R@@ ome - people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , O@@ .@@ K. ?
people believed that creativity was this di@@ vine atten@@ d@@ ant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and un@@ know@@ able source , for distant and un@@ know@@ able reasons .
the Gre@@ eks fam@@ ously called these di@@ vine atten@@ d@@ ant spiri@@ ts of creativity " da@@ em@@ ons . "
S@@ oc@@ rates , fam@@ ously , believed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spoke wisdom to him from af@@ ar .
the Rom@@ ans had the same idea , but they called that sort of dis@@ embo@@ died creative spirit a genius .
which is great , because the Rom@@ ans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this , sort of magical di@@ vine enti@@ ty , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist 's studio , kind of like D@@ obby the house elf , and who would come out and sort of inv@@ isi@@ bly ass@@ ist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work .
so brilliant - there it is , right there , that distance that I 'm talking about - that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work .
and everyone knew that this is how it func@@ tioned , right ?
so the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism , right ?
if your work was brilliant you couldn 't take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this dis@@ embo@@ died genius who had helped you .
if your work bom@@ bed , not entirely your fau@@ lt , you know ?
everyone knew your genius was kind of l@@ ame .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time .
and then the Ren@@ aissance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let 's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteri@@ es , and there 's no more room for my@@ s@@ tical creatures who take dic@@ tation from the di@@ vine .
and it 's the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
and for the first time in history , you start to hear people refer@@ ring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius .
and I got to tell you , I think that was a huge error .
you know , I think that allowing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the vessel , you know , like the f@@ ont and the essence and the source of all di@@ vine , creative , un@@ know@@ able , et@@ ernal mystery is just a s@@ mi@@ dge too much responsibility to put on one fragile , human p@@ sy@@ che .
it 's like asking somebody to sw@@ allow the sun .
it just completely war@@ ps and distor@@ ts e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ man@@ age@@ able expectations about performance .
and I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 5@@ 0@@ 0 years .
and , if this is true , and I think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
can we do this differently ?
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
maybe not .
maybe we can 't just er@@ ase 5@@ 0@@ 0 years of rational human@@ istic thought in one 1@@ 8 minute speech .
and there 's probably people in this audience who would raise really legi@@ timate scientific sus@@ pic@@ i@@ ons about the notion of , basically fai@@ ries who follow people around rub@@ bing fair@@ y ju@@ ice on their projects and stuff .
I 'm not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
but the question that I kind of want to pose is - you know , why not ?
why not think about it this way ?
because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ousness of the creative process .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something - which is to say basically everyone here - knows does not always behave ration@@ ally .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel down@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ru@@ th Stone , who 's now in her 9@@ 0 s , but she 's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
and she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous train of air .
and it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the landscape .
and she felt it coming , because it would shake the earth under her feet .
she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , " run like hell . "
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chas@@ ed by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could collect it and grab it on the page .
and other times she wouldn 't be fast enough , so she 'd be running and running and running , and she wouldn 't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it " for another poet . "
and then there were these times - this is the piece I never forgot - she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
so , she 's running to the house and she 's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her , and she grab@@ s a pen@@ cil just as it 's going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
she would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was tran@@ scri@@ bing on the page .
and in these inst@@ ances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards , from the last word to the first .
so when I heard that I was like - that 's un@@ can@@ ny , that 's exactly what my creative process is like .
that 's not at all what my creative process is - I 'm not the pi@@ peline !
I 'm a mu@@ le , and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day , and swe@@ at and labor and barrel through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ dly .
but even I , in my mul@@ ish@@ ness , even I have br@@ us@@ hed up against that thing , at times .
and I would imagine that a lot of you have too .
you know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify .
and what is that thing ?
and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us s@@ ane ?
and for me , the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Wa@@ its , who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment .
and we were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the embo@@ diment of the tor@@ mented contemporary modern artist , trying to control and manage and domin@@ ate these sort of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able creative impul@@ ses that were totally inter@@ n@@ alized .
but then he got older , he got cal@@ mer , and one day he was driving down the free@@ way in Los Angeles he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .
and he 's spe@@ eding along , and all of a sudden he hear@@ s this little frag@@ ment of melo@@ dy , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , el@@ usive and tan@@ tal@@ izing , and he wants it , you know , it 's gor@@ ge@@ ous , and he lon@@ gs for it , but he has no way to get it .
he doesn 't have a piece of paper , he doesn 't have a pen@@ cil , he doesn 't have a tape rec@@ order .
so he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like , " I 'm going to lose this thing , and then I 'm going to be ha@@ un@@ ted by this song forever .
I 'm not good enough , and I can 't do it . "
and instead of pan@@ ic@@ king , he just stopped .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , " Ex@@ c@@ use me , can you not see that I 'm driving ? "
" do I look like I can write down a song right now ?
if you really want to exist , come back at a more opport@@ une moment when I can take care of you .
otherwise , go bo@@ ther somebody else today .
go bo@@ ther Leon@@ ard C@@ ohen . "
and his whole work process changed after that .
not the work , the work was still of@@ ten@@ times as dark as ever .
but the process , and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the gen@@ ie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn 't have to be this inter@@ n@@ alized , tor@@ mented thing .
it could be this peculi@@ ar , won@@ dr@@ ous , bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange , external thing that was not quite Tom .
so when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too , and it already saved me once .
this idea , it saved me when I was in the middle of writing " E@@ at , Pr@@ ay , Love , " and I fell into one of those , sort of p@@ its of despair that we all fall into when we 're working on something and it 's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
and I started to think I should just d@@ ump this project .
but then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it .
so I just lif@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and I direc@@ ted my comments to an empty corner of the room .
and I said al@@ oud , " Listen you , thing , you and I both know that if this book isn 't brilliant that is not entirely my fau@@ lt , right ?
because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this , I don 't have any more than this .
so if you want it to be better , then you 've got to show up and do your part of the deal .
O@@ .@@ K. But if you don 't do that , you know what , the hell with it .
I 'm going to keep writing anyway because that 's my job .
and I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job . "
because - in the end it 's like this , O@@ .@@ K. - centuries ago in the deser@@ ts of North Africa , people used to gather for these mo@@ on@@ light dan@@ ces of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until dawn .
and they were always magnificent , because the dan@@ cers were professionals and they were terrific , right ?
but every once in a while , very rarely , something would happen , and one of these per@@ form@@ ers would actually become transc@@ endent .
and I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
it was like time would stop , and the dan@@ cer would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn 't doing anything different than he had ever done , 1@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 ni@@ ghts before , but everything would al@@ ign .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be merely human .
he would be lit from within , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with di@@ vin@@ ity .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
they would put their hands together and they would start to ch@@ ant , " All@@ ah , All@@ ah , All@@ ah , God , God , God . "
that 's God , you know .
curious historical foot@@ note - when the Mo@@ ors inv@@ aded southern Spain , they took this cu@@ st@@ om with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the centuries from " All@@ ah , All@@ ah , All@@ ah , " to " O@@ le , ole , ole , " which you still hear in bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ am@@ enc@@ o dan@@ ces .
in Spain , when a per@@ former has done something impossible and magic , " All@@ ah , ole , ole , All@@ ah , magnificent , bra@@ vo , " in@@ comprehen@@ sible , there it is - a gli@@ mp@@ se of God .
which is great , because we need that .
but , the tri@@ cky bit comes the next morning , for the dan@@ cer himself , when he wa@@ kes up and disco@@ vers that it 's Tu@@ es@@ day at 1@@ 1 a.m. , and he 's no longer a gli@@ mp@@ se of God .
he 's just an aging mor@@ tal with really bad k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he 's never going to as@@ c@@ end to that height again .
and maybe nobody will ever ch@@ ant God 's name again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
this is one of the most painful recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life .
but maybe it doesn 't have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .
but maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some un@@ imagin@@ able source for some ex@@ quisi@@ te portion of your life to be passed along when you 're finished , with somebody else .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
this is how I 've started to think , and this is certainly how I 've been thinking in the last few months as I 've been working on the book that will soon be published , as the danger@@ ously , frighten@@ ingly over-@@ anticip@@ ated follow up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish success .
and what I have to , sort of keep telling myself when I get really psych@@ ed out about that , is , don 't be afraid .
don 't be da@@ un@@ ted .
just do your job .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
if the di@@ vine , cock@@ eyed genius assig@@ ned to your case deci@@ des to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be gli@@ mp@@ sed , for just one moment through your efforts , then " O@@ le ! "
and if not , do your dance any@@ how .
and " O@@ le ! " to you , non@@ eth@@ eless .
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it .
" O@@ le ! " to you , non@@ eth@@ eless , just for having the sh@@ eer human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up .
thank you .
thank you .
O@@ le !
last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the ar@@ ctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 4@@ 8 states , has shr@@ unk by 4@@ 0 percent .
but this under@@ states the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem because it doesn 't show the th@@ ic@@ kness of the ice .
the ar@@ ctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system .
it exp@@ ands in winter and contrac@@ ts in summer .
the next slide I show you will be a rapid fa@@ st-@@ forward of what 's happened over the last 2@@ 5 years .
the permanent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
as you see , it exp@@ ands to the dark blue - that 's the annual ice in winter , and it contrac@@ ts in summer .
the so-called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , sp@@ ill@@ ing out of the body here .
in 2@@ 5 years it 's gone from this , to this .
this is a problem because the warming he@@ ats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into methane by microbes .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this ti@@ pping point .
already in some sh@@ allow la@@ kes in Alaska , methane is actively bub@@ bling up out of the water .
professor Kat@@ ey Wal@@ ter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another sh@@ allow lake last winter .
Who@@ a !
she 's okay . the question is whether we will be .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sin@@ k he@@ ats up Greenland from the north .
this is an annual melting river .
but the vol@@ um@@ es are much larger than ever .
this is the Kan@@ ger@@ lus@@ su@@ a@@ q River in sou@@ thwest Greenland .
if you want to know how sea level ris@@ es from land@@ -@@ base ice melting this is where it re@@ aches the sea .
these flows are increasing very rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet .
last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
and west Antarctica cro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melting .
that 's equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is Greenland .
in the Himal@@ ay@@ as , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were glaci@@ ers .
4@@ 0 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow .
in the An@@ des , this gl@@ acier is the source of drinking water for this city .
the flows have increased .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
in California there has been a 4@@ 0 percent decline in the Sierra sn@@ ow@@ pack .
this is hitting the reser@@ vo@@ irs .
and the predictions , as you 've read , are serious .
this dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires .
and the dis@@ asters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate .
four times as many in the last 3@@ 0 years as in the previous 7@@ 5 .
this is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
in the last five years we 've added 7@@ 0 million tons of CO2 every 2@@ 4 hours - 2@@ 5 million tons every day to the oceans .
look carefully at the area of the e@@ astern Pacific , from the Americ@@ as , exten@@ ding west@@ ward , and on either side of the Indian sub@@ continent , where there is a radical de@@ ple@@ tion of oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
the United States is one of the two largest em@@ it@@ ters , along with China .
and the pro@@ posal has been to build a lot more coal plants .
but we 're beginning to see a sea change .
here are the ones that have been canc@@ elled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed .
However there is a political battle in our country .
and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ end@@ ar year promo@@ ting clean coal , which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
that image reminded me of something .
around Christmas , in my home in T@@ enn@@ es@@ see , a billion gall@@ ons of coal s@@ lu@@ dge was sp@@ illed .
you probably saw it on the news .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in America .
this happened around Christmas .
one of the coal industry 's ads around Christmas was this one .
fro@@ sty the coal man is a j@@ ol@@ ly , happy soul .
he 's abund@@ ant here in America , and he helps our economy grow .
fro@@ sty the coal man is getting clean@@ er everyday .
he 's affordable and ad@@ or@@ able , and workers keep their pay .
this is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia .
the largest moun@@ tain@@ top min@@ er is the head of Mas@@ sey Co@@ al .
let me be clear about it . Al Gore , N@@ ancy P@@ elo@@ si , Harry Rei@@ d , they don 't know what they 're talking about .
so the Al@@ liance for Cli@@ mate Prot@@ ection has launched two campaig@@ ns .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
at CO@@ AL@@ ergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
that 's why we 've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal isn 't dirty .
we think it 's clean - sm@@ ells good , too .
so don 't worry about climate change .
leave that up to us .
clean coal - you 've heard a lot about it .
so let 's take a tour of this stat@@ e-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art clean coal facility .
amazing ! the mach@@ in@@ ery is kind of loud .
but that 's the sound of clean coal technology .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
take a good long look : this is today 's clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative mes@@ hes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
America is in crisis - the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the th@@ read that links them all : our addiction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there is a b@@ old new solution to get us out of this mess .
Re@@ power America with 1@@ 0@@ 0 percent clean electricity within 1@@ 0 years .
a plan to put America back to work , make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that 's big enough to solve our problems .
Re@@ power America . find out more .
this is the last one .
it 's about re@@ powering America .
one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
future 's over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
new investments to create high-@@ paying jobs .
Re@@ power America . it 's time to get real .
there is an old African pro@@ ver@@ b that says , " If you want to go quickly , go alone .
if you want to go far , go together . "
we need to go far , quickly .
thank you very much .
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
as you figured out how to reach out and grasp , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipul@@ ating spati@@ al relationships .
spati@@ al reas@@ oning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this utili@@ ty of our interactions with physical objects - along with my advis@@ er P@@ att@@ ie , and my collabor@@ ator Je@@ ev@@ an Kal@@ an@@ i@@ th@@ i - I started to wonder - what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cur@@ sor that was a like a digital finger@@ tip moving around a flat desktop , what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically , arran@@ ging it the way we wanted ?
this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer , by building Si@@ ft@@ ables .
in a nu@@ t@@ shell , a Si@@ ft@@ able is an interactive computer the size of a cook@@ ie .
they 're able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
most importantly , they 're physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and gras@@ ping .
and Si@@ ft@@ ables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipul@@ ating digital information .
and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction st@@ y@@ les .
so , I 'm going to start with some simple examples .
this Si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ figured to show video , and if I ti@@ lt it in one direction , it 'll roll the video this way ; if I ti@@ lt it the other way it roll@@ s it backwards .
and these interactive por@@ traits are aware of each other .
so if I put them next to each other , they get interested .
if they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
and they can also sense their motion and ti@@ lt .
one of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday ges@@ tures on data , like p@@ our@@ ing a color the way we might pour a liquid .
so in this case , we 've got three Si@@ ft@@ ables con@@ figured to be paint bu@@ ckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mixed .
if we over@@ shoot , we can pour a little bit back .
there are also some neat possibilities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
so here I 'm - This is a Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence that I 'm making with a simple equation program .
here we have a word game that 's kind of like a mas@@ h@@ -up between S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble and B@@ og@@ gle .
basically , in every round you get a random@@ ly assig@@ ned letter on each Si@@ ft@@ able , and as you try to make words it chec@@ ks against a dictionary .
then , after about 3@@ 0 seconds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
thank you .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab , and I managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
they really loved it .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is , " Ma@@ ke words , " and they know exactly what to do .
so here 's another few people trying it out .
that 's our yo@@ un@@ gest bet@@ a tes@@ ter , down there on the right .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the Si@@ ft@@ ables up .
so to him , they were just blocks .
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ ners .
and this is Fel@@ ix , actually .
and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by lif@@ ting the Si@@ ft@@ ables off the table that have that character shown on them .
here , he 's bringing the sun out .
the sun is rising .
now he 's brought a trac@@ tor into the scene .
the orange trac@@ tor .
good job ! Yeah !
so by sha@@ king the Si@@ ft@@ ables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact - Wo@@ of !
inv@@ enting his own narrative .
Hello !
it 's an open-@@ ended story , and he gets to decide how it un@@ folds .
fly away , cat .
so , the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequ@@ encing and live performance tool that we 've built recently , in which Si@@ ft@@ ables act as sounds like lead , b@@ ass and dr@@ ums .
each of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
and you can in@@ ject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want .
and you in@@ ject it by just b@@ umping up the sound Si@@ ft@@ able against a sequence Si@@ ft@@ able .
there are effects that you can control live , like rever@@ b and filter .
you att@@ ach it to a particular sound and then ti@@ lt to ad@@ just it .
and then , overall effects like temp@@ o and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
so let 's have a look .
we 'll start by putting a lead into two sequence Si@@ ft@@ ables , ar@@ range them into a series , extend it , add a little more lead .
now I put a b@@ ass line in .
now I 'll put some perc@@ us@@ sion in .
and now I 'll att@@ ach the filter to the dr@@ ums , so I can control the effect live .
I can speed up the whole sequence by til@@ ting the temp@@ o one way or the other .
and now I 'll att@@ ach the filter to the b@@ ass for some more expression .
I can re@@ ar@@ range the sequence while it plays .
so I don 't have to plan it out in advance , but I can improvis@@ e , making it longer or shor@@ ter as I go .
and now , finally , I can fa@@ de the whole sequence out using the volume Si@@ ft@@ able , til@@ ted to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human-@@ computer inter@@ faces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
and today , I had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we 're working to bring out of the laboratory .
so the thought I want to leave you with is that we 're on the c@@ us@@ p of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
thank you very much .
I look forward to talking with all of you .
